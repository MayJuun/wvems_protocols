      '3 How To Use Welcome to the WVEMS Protocols 2023 • Think of this like a tool box, not a cookbook. • You should use several protocols at the same time on every call. • You may use any intervention marked for your level or lower. Basic procedures are assumed for every call. • Don’t forget: scene safe, BSI, ABC’s, call for ALS, notify the ED, etc. • Every patient should have a full assessment including vital signs. • Ask about medical allergies and pregnancy before giving meds. Call for online Medical Direction at any time for advice on: • Any questions, problems, or if uncertain for any reason. • Getting permission to deviate from these protocols. • If unable to contact, remember: get the patient to the hospital. Protocols mean you can, but not always that you should. • Use only enough to stabilize and/or improve. Don’t follow blindly. • Skip anything unnecessary. Not every box needs to be completed. • The listed order suggests importance, but is not absolute. Severity is a subjective judgement that requires thought. • Not all decisions are black and white. Use this text as a guide. • Reassess and restart protocols as needed during a call. • Use good clinical sense to decide what takes precedence. Presume routine things when appropriate, like: • SpO2, EKG, EtCO2, glucometer, phlebotomy, etc. • Regular layperson ﬁrst aid treatments like splinting & band-aids. • Note: protocols may also include reminders (like “12-Lead”). Pediatric considerations are included in every protocol. • Patients 14 y/o and over (14+) are generally given adult therapy. • Children (1-13) and Infants ( <1) are considered peds. • Use Peds Reference or other approved source for peds dosing. Critical Care is for credentialed paramedics only. • Provider’s responsibility to maintain mandatory prerequisites. • Must be approved for that speciﬁc protocol by the agency OMD. Reviewed: Jun 2023 • All deadlines expire on the last day of the month (a grace period). References are included. This text is not comprehensive. • Medications may appear as brand name® or generic.

      ' 5 Alias: Choking, Suction, Oral Airway, BIAD Airway Imperatives • Maintain the simplest effective airway. Escalate only if needed. • If BIAD fails, try again with a different size. - Most common failure of a BIAD is inappropropriate size. • Use several techniques to conﬁrm airway: - Physical Exam: lung sounds, skin color, chest rise, etc. - Vitals: rising SpO2, good EtCO2 (capnography or capnometry) • Be prepared to escalate airway if signs of Poor Perfusion. • E May Suction Nose/BIAD/ETT/trach/stoma with ﬂexible cath. Poor Perfusion • Suspect if several of these: - Altered Mental Status - Skin Pale, Cool, Diaphoretic - Tachycardia, Hypotension - Dyspnea, Tachypnea Notes • Secure BIAD well. Use tape or manufactured holding device. - May place c-collar (even without trauma) to help stabilize. - A Consider placing an OG-Tube if BIAD will accommodate it. • Use caution with NPA if any signs of facial trauma. • Reposition with: Head Tilt / Chin Lift (med) or Jaw Thrust (trauma). • Endotracheal intubation is not included in this protocol. NEMSIS: 9914001, 9914003, 9914005 - Consider Intubation if appropriate and cleared for Critical Care. Pediatrics • Be suspicious for an airway obstruction, especially with stridor. • Use back blows if indicated. Do not use blind ﬁnger sweeps.

Avoid hyperventilation. - During CPR: alternate 30 : 2 until BIAD (or ETT) is placed. • NIPPV: Requires a patient that is awake and compliant. - Contraindicated with vomiting, hypotension or altered LOC. BVM Rate • Adult: Q 6 sec (10 /min) • Peds: Q 2 sec (20-30 /min) Notes • Provide O2 at appropriate doses. Titrate for effect. - Nasal Cannula (NC): 1 - 6 L/min - Non-Rebreather (NRB): 10 - 15 L/min • Consider reducing supplemental O2 if SpO2 rises above 98%. - Hyperoxia can make some conditions worse, especially COPD. - Target SpO2 of 88-92% for adults with isolated COPD. • If SpO2 unavailable or machine fails: use good clinical judgment. • SCUBA injury may cause hypoxia: consider if any recent diving. NEMSIS: 9914001, 9914211 Pediatrics • Refer to Neonate for any peds under 1 month ( < 31 days) old. • Use caution and appropriately sized BVM to prevent barotrauma.

May titrate up to 4x if needed. - Average adults start around 1 drop every 5 sec (with micro set). Notes • Give ﬂuids and reassess. Start pressors if poor response. • Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is a better indicator when available. - Consider Vasopressors if appropriate & cleared for Critical Care. Pediatrics • The majority of peds decompensation is airway related. • Fluids are important for hypotension. Pressors are a last resort.
