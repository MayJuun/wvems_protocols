    "2": "2 How To Use Welcome to the WVEMS Protocols 2022 • Think of this like a tool box, not a cookbook. • You should use several protocols at the same time on every call. • You may use any intervention marked for your level or lower. Basic procedures are assumed for every call. • Don’t forget: scene safe, BSI, ABC’s, call for ALS, notify the ED, etc. • Every patient should have a full assessment including vital signs. • Ask about medical allergies and pregnancy before giving meds. Call for online Medical Direction at any time for advice on: • Any questions, problems, or if uncertain for any reason. • Getting permission to deviate from these protocols. • If unable to contact, remember: get the patient to the hospital. Protocols mean you can, but not always that you should. • Use only enough to stabilize and/or improve. Don’t follow blindly. • Skip anything unnecessary. Not every box need to be completed. • The listed order suggests importance, but is not absolute. Severity is a subjective judgement that requires thought. • Not all decisions are black and white. Use this text as a guide. • Reassess and restart protocols as needed during a call. • Use good clinical sense to decide what takes precedence. Presume routine things when appropriate, like: • SpO2, EKG, EtCO2, glucometer, phlebotomy, etc. • Regular layperson ﬁrst aid treatments like splinting & band-aids. • Note: protocols may also include reminders (like “12-Lead”). Pediatric considerations are included in every protocol. • Patients 14 y/o and over (14+) are generally given adult therapy. • Children (1-13) and Infants ( <1) are considered peds. • Use Peds Reference or other approved source for peds dosing. Critical Care is for credentialed paramedics only. • Provider’s responsibility to maintain mandatory prerequisites. • Must be approved for that speciﬁc protocol by the agency OMD. Reviewed: Apr 2022 • All deadlines expire on the last day of the month (a grace period). References are included. This text is not comprehensive. • Medications may appear as brand name® or generic.

Under extenuating circumstances, such as back-to-back calls with no time in-between to exchange the box, or in a mass casualty situation, it may be necessary to use a box on more than one patient. Such use must be appropriately documented on the patient care reports. • Agencies participating in the regional drug box exchange program shall follow the procedures below regarding the use and exchange of boxes at regional hospitals. 1. EMS provider breaks RED drug box seal and places broken seal in top tray. There will be a new (unused) GREEN seal in both the drug box, and in the narcotics box, and these must be retained for resealing the opened box(es) after use. 2. EMS provider documents medications used on the patient care report and the WVEMS/BREMS Regional Pharmacy Administration Record Physician Order Form. A physician’s signature shall be obtained when a provider obtains online orders for medications (including DEA number in any and all cases where online orders for narcotics are used). Boxes will be returned to the Emergency Department, if the signature of the physician or nurse is not legible and/or there is not a DEA number when needed and the regional council will be notiﬁed. Enter the RESEAL serial number(s) on the WVEMS/BREMS Pharmacy Administration Record - Physician Order Form. 3. EMS provider and E.D. nurse, physician, pharmacist pharmacy technician and/or other person as authorized, checks used box to account for narcotics. Both assure that all trash and used needles have been removed from the box. The old (broken) seal should be left in the box and forwarded to the pharmacy. The nurse, physician, or authorized person will sign the appropriate space indicating that all narcotics have been accounted for.

E.D. nurse, physician, pharmacist or pharmacy technician, or authorized person issues a new box to the EMS provider. Both complete the “Drug Box Exchange Log”. The seal on the new box is not to be broken until needed on the scene of an emergency. Boxes on which seals have been broken must be returned to the E.D. or Pharmacy for exchange. The medical facility may require additional documentation. If the facility requires a copy of a PPCR or patient reporting printout with an explanation of why the seal was broken, this must accompany the box. 5. Pharmacy will ﬁll the box, replacing used items, in accordance with the box schematic. The pharmacy checks the box to assure all contents are present and in-date. The box is sealed with a numbered seal provided by the EMS Council. A hospital sticker indicating the date of the ﬁrst drug to expire is to be placed on the outside of the box. 6. If a box is returned to the pharmacy with dirty needles or excessive litter and debris, the box will be taken out of service and the EMS Council notiﬁed. The Council will notify the agency and/or personnel responsible and they will be required to report to the hospital to correct the situation. Repeated occurrences by the same provider/agency may result in suspension or revocation of drug box privileges. 7. Reﬁlled boxes are returned to the E.D. or stored in the pharmacy for distribution. Each hospital is responsible to ensure that the boxes are properly secured against tampering while at the hospital. 8. If an EMS provider opens a box and ﬁnds one or more medications missing, the provider shall document such on the PPCR or patient reporting software and the EMS provider shall notify the EMS Council in writing of the discrepancy; noting the box number and seal number in the report. If the missing drug is a narcotic refer to item # 11. As long as the missing medication is not a narcotic, the box may be returned to service by the hospital pharmacy after restocking. 9. No item for item exchange of drug box contents may be made in the E.D. The box must be returned to the pharmacy to be checked, restocked, and resealed. 10.

Appropriate bystanders may assist with common ﬁrst aid when EMS resources are insufficient. EMS must direct bystanders and maintain overall responsibility. • ALS interventions are only appropriate by responding ALS resources. A formal mutual aid agreement or authorization by Medical Control must exist prior to delivery of ALS interventions. EMS has no authority to enable non-EMS medical personnel (RN, NP, PA, CRNA, RT, etc.) to perform ALS interventions. Physician Orders • Physicians represent a unique resource. EMS may follow written or verbal orders from a patient's established physician. EMS may also follow appropriate verbal orders from a physician Reviewed: Apr 2022 bystander on scene.
