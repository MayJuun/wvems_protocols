    "3": "Welcome to the WVEMS Protocols • Think of this like a tool box, not a cookbook. • You should use several protocols at the same time on every call. • You may use any intervention marked for your level or lower. Basic procedures are assumed for every call. • Don’t forget: scene safe, BSI, ABC’s, call for ALS, notify the ED, etc. • Every patient should have a full assessment including vital signs. • Ask about medical allergies and pregnancy before giving meds. Call for online Medical Direction at any time for advice on: • Any questions, problems, or if uncertain for any reason. • Getting permission to deviate from these protocols. • If unable to contact, remember: get the patient to the hospital. Protocols mean you can, but not always that you should. • Use only enough to stabilize and/or improve. Don’t follow blindly. • Skip anything unnecessary. Not every box needs to be completed. • The listed order suggests importance, but it is not absolute. Severity is a subjective judgement that requires thought. • Not all decisions are black and white. Use this text as a guide. • Reassess and restart protocols as needed during a call. • Use good clinical sense to decide what takes precedence. Presume routine things when appropriate, like: • SpO2, EKG, EtCO2, glucometer, saline lock, phlebotomy, etc. • Regular layperson first aid treatments like splinting & band-aids. • Note: protocols may also include reminders (like “12-Lead”). Pediatric considerations are included in every protocol. • Patients 14 y/o and over (14+) are generally given adult therapy. • Children ( 1 - 13 y/o) and Infants ( < 1 y/o) are considered peds. • Use Peds Reference for peds dosing & adults under 110 lbs (50 kg). References are included. This text is not comprehensive. • Medications may appear as brand name® or generic. Critical Care (CC) is for credentialed paramedics only. • Provider’s responsibility to maintain mandatory prerequisites. • Must be approved for that specific protocol by the agency OMD. • All deadlines expire on the last day of the month (a grace period).

Occasionally, bystanders may be crucial to providing or assisting with treatment. Bystanders can be considered when the immediate needs outweigh the EMS resources available, or if a bystander can provide a unique resource. EMS should never authorize or perform any intervention outside their scope or comfort level. • Bystanders may have a unique understanding of a specialized medical condition or device. EMS should consider the advice of patients or bystanders such as: case workers/patient aides, or mental health professionals, or caretakers managing a vent at home, or a patient with an LVAD, etc. EMS must call Medical Control for any orders to deviate from routine EMS care. • BLS procedures are frequently taught as a component of common ﬁrst aid. Appropriate bystanders may assist with common ﬁrst aid when EMS resources are insufficient. EMS must direct bystanders and maintain overall responsibility. • ALS interventions are only appropriate by responding ALS resources. A formal mutual aid agreement or authorization by Medical Control must exist prior to delivery of ALS interventions. EMS has no authority to enable non-EMS medical personnel (RN, NP, PA, CRNA, RT, etc.) to perform ALS interventions. Physician Orders • Physicians represent a unique resource. EMS may follow written or verbal orders from a patient's established physician. EMS may also follow appropriate verbal orders from a physician Reviewed: Apr 2024 bystander on scene.
